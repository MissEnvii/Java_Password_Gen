# Welcome to the Password generator!
### My goal is to create a wedsite that will generate a random password depending on the criteria that the user selects. My goal was to make it simple and easy to use. 

## User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

# My process!
**So Since my goal was to make the process on making a password a bit easier I wanted to add a section that will show when you press the generate password button. But in order for me to do that I need to add a few things to my HTML and CSS files. My first goal was to make sure I made an easy interafce with the HTML File. Here I added a section where you can choose how manny chartures you want in your password and check mark what you want to add to your password.**
